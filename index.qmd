I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher in Statistics and Data Science** with research interests at the intersection of  
**non-parametric inference**, **inverse problems**, and **shape-constrained estimation**.

My work combines **rigorous theoretical analysis** with **methodological development** and **applications to real-world data**, with a particular focus on **measurement error models**, **deconvolution techniques**, and **survival analysis**.

## Research Profile

I hold a **PhD in Statistics**, with a doctoral thesis devoted to the estimation of the **hazard rate function under additive measurement error**. My research established theoretical properties of non-parametric estimators, including **convergence results**, **asymptotic distributions**, and **almost sure behavior**, and demonstrated their performance on real survival data.

I have **over five years of experience** in statistical research and data analysis, with strong expertise in **R programming**, simulation-based studies, and data visualization. I actively collaborate across disciplines and contribute to the development of robust statistical tools for contaminated data.
