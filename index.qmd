## Welcome

Welcome to my personal academic website.

I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in the **Department of Economic Sciences** at the **University of Bergamo (Italy)**, working under the supervision of *Prof. Tomaso Lando*. My research lies at the intersection of **non-parametric statistics**, **inverse problems**, and **shape-constrained estimation**, with a strong emphasis on both **theoretical foundations** and **applications to real data**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Interests

My main research interests include:

-   Non-parametric estimation and testing\
-   Inverse problems and **deconvolution methods**\
-   Kernel methods and Fourier-based techniques\
-   Shape-constrained inference (monotonicity, hazard rates, TTT transform)\
-   Asymptotic theory (weak convergence, almost sure convergence)\
-   Statistical computing and simulation studies in **R**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

I hold a **PhD in Statistics**, where my thesis focused on the estimation of the **hazard rate function under additive measurement error**, including: - Quadratic mean convergence\
- Asymptotic distributions\
- Almost sure convergence properties

I have **10+ years of experience** in data analysis and statistical computing, with strong expertise in **R**, simulation studies, and data visualization.

## Current Work

I am currently working on:

\- Non-parametric tests under additive noise\
- Deconvolution-based and shape-constrained CDF estimation\
- Power analysis via simulation\
- Applications to reliability and lifetime data
