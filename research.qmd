## Research Overview

My research lies at the intersection of **non-parametric statistics**, **inverse problems**, and **shape-constrained inference**, with a strong emphasis on **theoretical foundations** and **methodological development** motivated by real data applications.

I am particularly interested in statistical inference under **measurement error**, where classical procedures fail and deconvolution-based techniques are required. My work combines **kernel methods**, **Fourier techniques**, and **asymptotic theory** to construct estimators and tests with provable guarantees.

## Main Research Themes

### 🔹 Non-Parametric Estimation under Measurement Error

A central part of my research focuses on estimating distributional and functional characteristics when observations are contaminated by **additive noise**. This includes:

- Density and distribution function estimation via **deconvolution**
- Hazard rate estimation under error-in-variables models
- Study of **quadratic mean**, **almost sure**, and **weak convergence**
- Bandwidth selection and bias–variance trade-offs

These problems naturally arise in reliability analysis, survival analysis, and applied economics.

### 🔹 Inverse Problems and Deconvolution Methods

Inverse problems form the theoretical backbone of my work. I investigate:

- Ill-posedness in statistical inverse problems
- Regularization through kernel and Fourier-based approaches
- Noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) effects on estimator performance
- Minimax rates and asymptotic distributions

Special attention is given to **Gamma, Gaussian, and Laplace noise structures**, motivated by applied contexts.

### 🔹 Shape-Constrained Inference

I am actively working on **shape constraints** as a way to improve efficiency and interpretability of estimators, including:

- Monotonicity and convexity constraints
- Shape-constrained CDF and hazard rate estimation
- Constrained vs unconstrained estimator comparisons
- Projection-based methods under noise contamination

These ideas are currently explored in the context of **deconvolution-based tests**.

### 🔹 Non-Parametric Testing

My recent work includes the development of **non-parametric hypothesis tests** under measurement error, such as:

- Monotonicity testing using the **Total Time on Test (TTT) transform**
- Simulation-based power analysis
- Bootstrap and asymptotic calibration
- Applications to lifetime and reliability data

## Applications and Data Analysis

Although my work is theoretically grounded, I maintain a strong interest in applications, particularly in:

- Reliability and survival data
- Economic and environmental datasets
- Simulation studies to validate asymptotic results

I regularly use **R** for implementation, visualization, and reproducible research, with a focus on clean, modular, and extensible code.
