    "text": "Main Research Themes\n\n🔹 Non-Parametric Estimation under Measurement Error\nA central part of my research focuses on estimating distributional and functional characteristics when observations are contaminated by additive noise. This includes:\n\nDensity and distribution function estimation via deconvolution\nHazard rate estimation under error-in-variables models\nStudy of quadratic mean, almost sure, and weak convergence\nBandwidth selection and bias–variance trade-offs\n\nThese problems naturally arise in reliability analysis, survival analysis, and applied economics.\n\n\n\n🔹 Inverse Problems and Deconvolution Methods\nInverse problems form the theoretical backbone of my work. I investigate:\n\nIll-posedness in statistical inverse problems\nRegularization through kernel and Fourier-based approaches\nNoise-to-signal ratio (NSR) effects on estimator performance\nMinimax rates and asymptotic distributions\n\nSpecial attention is given to Gamma, Gaussian, and Laplace noise structures, motivated by applied contexts.\n\n\n\n🔹 Shape-Constrained Inference\nI am actively working on shape constraints as a way to improve efficiency and interpretability of estimators, including:\n\nMonotonicity and convexity constraints\nShape-constrained CDF and hazard rate estimation\nConstrained vs unconstrained estimator comparisons\nProjection-based methods under noise contamination\n\nThese ideas are currently explored in the context of deconvolution-based tests.\n\n\n\n🔹 Non-Parametric Testing\nMy recent work includes the development of non-parametric hypothesis tests under measurement error, such as:\n\nMonotonicity testing using the Total Time on Test (TTT) transform\nSimulation-based power analysis\nBootstrap and asymptotic calibration\nApplications to lifetime and reliability data"
