## Ben Jrada Mohammed Es-salih

I am a **statistician and postdoctoral researcher** specializing in **non-parametric inference**, with strong expertise in **inverse problems** and **deconvolution methods**. My research combines **theoretical rigor** with **practical implementation**, aiming to develop robust statistical methodologies for data contaminated by measurement error.

My work spans **shape-constrained estimation**, **asymptotic theory**, and **simulation-based inference**, with a particular focus on applications in **survival analysis** and **reliability theory**.

I have extensive experience in **statistical computing using R**, including methodological development, simulation studies, and data visualization, and I actively engage in interdisciplinary research collaborations.
